# Backend-based-
A simple Contact Form project built using HTML, Bootstrap, and Node.js with Express.js. 
The form collects user input (name, email, subject, and message) and sends it to a Node.js backend. 
The backend processes the data and stores it in a local JSON file for record-keeping. 
Includes form validation, file upload option, and success/error message display without page reload using Fetch API.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5 & Bootstrap 5 (Frontend)
- JavaScript Fetch API (Form Submission)
- Node.js & Express.js (Backend)
- Body-Parser & CORS (Middleware)
- File System (JSON Data Storage)
